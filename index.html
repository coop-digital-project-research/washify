<h1>WeWash</h1>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>A good washing machine - one that will last and works well - is expensive - too expensive for many of us. Cheaper models don't work as well and fail quickly (often as soon as the warranty runs out).</p>
<p>This is true of many of big items in our lives - cars, technology, property - which is why we opt to rent, hire or lease instead of buying outright. </p>
<p>But there's a problem with renting too - especially washing machines. If you rent a washing machine, you'll end up paying far more. And many rental agreements mean you end up owning it - an old, outdated machine that's past its best.</p>
<h2>The solution: WeWash</h2>
<p>We think a washing machine should cost &pound;15 a month and no more. No contract, no interest payments. We think that repairs and replacements should be included, and be speedy (under 48 hours). Two days is long enough to go without clean clothes!</p>
<p>We believe we can offer WeWash to everybody; people on a budget, people who don't have much time; people who rent out properties. To do this, we need to find out a bit more - and that's where you come in.</p>
<p>We'd love to find out whether you think WeWash will work for you. Sign up for email updates, and we'll keep you posted as we develop this idea. We may contact you to find out what you think about WeWash - your views will help us build WeWash for everyone.</p>
  <p>We think WeWash will be great for:</p>
