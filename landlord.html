<h2> Landlords - take the hassle out of washing machines </h2>
<p> We think that there's a problem with washing machines. The cheap ones don't last, the expensive ones are, well, expensive. They're a pain to maintain and to dispose of when they die. </p>
<p>We believe we can do better: a washing machine for &pound;15 a month - no contract, no interest. If it breaks, we'll repair it or replace it within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Sounds good? We're working on this idea - if you want to get involved, sign up for email updates</p>
