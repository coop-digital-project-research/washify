<h1> WeWash </h1>
<h2> You don't need to make a big up-front payment for clean clothes</h2>
<p> We think that there's a problem with washing machines. The cheap ones don't last, the expensive ones are, well, expensive. They're a pain to maintain and to dispose of when they die. </p>

<p>We believe we can do better: a washing machine for &pound;15 a month - no contract, no interest. If it breaks, we'll repair it or replace it within 48 hours.</p>

<p>Cheaper than buying up front; more convenient than the launderette. We'll even throw in some laundry liquid - and send you a regular refill.</p>

<p>Sounds good? We're working on this idea - if you want to get involved, sign up for email updates</p>
