<h1> WeWash </h1>
<h2>A washing machine that lightens your load</h2>
<p>There's a problem with washing machines. The cheap ones don't last. The expensive ones are, well, expensive. They're a pain to maintain and to get rid of of when they die.</p>
<p>Rentals are no better: you pay more than buying outright, and you end up owning an old machine at the end of its life. </p>
<p>We think we can do better: </p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;15 a month flat fee</li>
<li>no contract</li>
<li>48 hour repairs or replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll even throw in a free laundry liquid subscription.</p>
<p>Sounds good? We're working on this idea: to get involved, sign up for email updates</p>
